Praktikum Informatik 2

Code written for Praktikum Informatik 2 at RWTH Aachen (https://www.ids.rwth-aachen.de/lehrstuhl/42-thomas-dondorf.html).

Disclaimer: the file SimuClient.h was not written by me, I decided to leave it so that the code remains fully understandable.
The visual client (Java server) was not included and is only available at the RWTHmoodle platform for participants of the course.
